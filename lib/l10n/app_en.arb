On 30th May 1960, the Council for Religious Affairs shifted its office to Dharamsala and on September 12, 1960, it became one of the seven main departments when His Holiness the Dalai Lama formally established the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).\nUnder the affiliation of this department, there are 255 monasteries and 37 nunneries in India, Nepal and Bhutan and also five cultural institutions across India",
  "aboutAppDescription": "In 1959, Tibet experienced a major upheaval that resulted in the destruction of over 6,000 monasteries and priceless historical documents. Despite this devastating period, the Tibetan community in exile, led by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and other religious leaders, has worked tirelessly over the past 65 years to rebuild and preserve Tibetan cultural heritage.\nWith economic and living standards improving globally, tourism has been steadily increasing across various regions. Pilgrims and travelers visiting Tibetan settlements now include not just Tibetans, but also Himalayan Buddhists, Indians and numerous international visitors. In response to this growing interest, the Department of Religion and Culture of the Central Tibetan Administration has developed a mobile application that provides a useful guide for visitors to Tibetan monasteries and sacred Buddhist sites. This Neykor application serves as an innovative educational tool, allowing diverse groups of visitors to gain meaningful insights into the rich background of Tibetan monasteries and their significant religious artifacts, thereby promoting cultural awareness and appreciation.\nThrough this mobile app, travelers can learn about Tibetan monasteries, sacred artifacts, Buddhist sites and important Tibetan festivals. The application helps visitors understand the value of Tibetan culture and religion, particularly targeting young Tibetans and Himalayan Buddhists. We hope that this application will provide meaningful information about the Tibetan monasteries and its sacred statues and religious artifacts for the users.",
